# toASCII
 A simple Python terminal application that converts PNG and JPEG images into ASCII art using the pillow library. Written in Python.
 
 IMPORTANT: You may need to install pillow library on your machine in order to use this application.

 How to use: first specify your terminal colour; if its dark, type d, and if its bright type b. This will make ASCII art display properly on your terminal.
 Then enter a file path of an image you would like to convert to ASCII art, including the image file itself (example: user/pictures/image.png). The file path must be absolute if the pictures are not in the same folder as the Python file. There are 3 sample images included in the repository. After that you need to zoom out on your terminal window in order to properly display the ASCII art.
